			<h3> Evaluating the User Interface of Craigslist</h3>

		<p class="quotes"> This website is completely ad free and free to use. Without the cluter of ads and the need to register or login, any user can use the website easily. The categories are clearly defined in columms, with subcategories listed underneath. One can also use the search bar to locate an exact item. It is also very simple to post an advertisement - the site prompts the user to choose a category, then a sub-category, and finally create the advertisement page. The website is free of clutter and the interface is very minimalistic. Even the colors - white, and black with blue links - is very simple and one might even say boring. However, the simplistic design and interface of the website are what contribute to the success of Craigslist.
