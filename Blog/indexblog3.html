			<h3> Pocketful of Interface</h3>
         
         <br>

		<p> This is my first take on user interface design. I took a photo of some of my everday items, and I created a hover effect with seperate images. The images were edited on Gimp software, and the final pictures are not of great quality. By hovering over the item, it becomes bigger and highlights a blue color. This makes it easy for the user to see what is being interacted. All the elements are on a single picture, which made it difficult to crop out individual items on Gimp, but it makes for a more streamlined design. The info panels are on the border of the picture, out of the way of the interface. It is a rather simple design, and if I could do it again, I would use better image editing software.
