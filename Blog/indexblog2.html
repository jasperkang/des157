			<h3> Evaluating the web-based form of FAFSA</h3>
         
         <br>

         <p> Bill Derouchey's <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">article</a> on interface design shows us how we can get inspiration from everyday technology in our designs. The modes of interaction are through color, icons, words, size, shape, layout, motion, sequence, sound and feel. The elements of interaction should have some sort of hierarchy, so that they are grouped by similarity, with the highest priority given the most attention. The design must also communicate clearly for any user to interact with. Finally, the design must have a clear purpose to serve the product. </p>
             
         <p>
        The interface of the online FAFSA application, which is rather lengthy, is eased by the use of many subcategories for the forms. It is ordered by heirarchy, with the most basic information being first, and the financial information being last. The user can save the form to come back to finish it at any time. The ease of use of this online form is imperative, as federal student aid must be accessed by a vast number of people.
