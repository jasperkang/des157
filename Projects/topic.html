    Topic 1: Stray dogs are a problem in many countries and cities. I would like to explore the possibility of using of website to address this problem. An "online shelter" where people can upload photos and profiles of stray dogs, and others can adopt or donate to the cause. The website would be categorized by country and city, and veterinarians could be hired to work for the online shelter or volunteer. The website would be non-profit.

    Topic 2: Old or unused items and clothing are often thrown away instead of being given to someone who can use them. I want to explore the possibility of creating a website or app that encourages people to recycle or donate their unwanted goods that are otherwise in good condition. By reuse of products, we can decrease manufacturing processes. One idea to solve this issue is by creating a website where people can donate these items to people in need. The sellers of the items would have the option of donating to a verified charity or selling at a low cost. A percentage of the cost could then be donated to a charity.

    Topic 3: A website where people can upload photos and stories of homeless people. Homeless people have no voice and people often make assumptions about why they are homeless. This website would serve as a voice for the homeless, and individuals can have profile pages with their photos and stories taken from people who stopped by to talk to them. Anyone would be able to donate on the website or even offer housing to the homeless.
