    Topic 1: Stray dogs are a problem in many countries and cities. I would like to explore the possibility of using of website to address this problem. An "online shelter" where people can upload photos and profiles of stray dogs, and others can adopt or donate to the cause. The website would be categorized by country and city, and veterinarians could be hired to work for the online shelter or volunteer. The website would be non-profit.

    Topic 2: Old or unused items and clothing are often thrown away instead of being given to someone who can use them. One idea to solve this issue is by creating a website where people can donate these items to people in need.
    Instead of going to a thrift store, where money and profit is involved, this website would be non-profit and not involve any money. All the items should be free of charge, and there should be some way to verify that these items are going to someone in need and not someone who is trying to profit from the system.

    Topic 3: A website where people can upload photos and stories of homeless people. Homeless people have no voice and people often make assumptions about why they are homeless. This website would serve as a voice for the homeless, and individuals can have profile pages with their photos and stories taken from people who stopped by to talk to them. Anyone would be able to donate on the website or even offer housing to the homeless.
