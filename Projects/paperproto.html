    This paper prototype illustrates the home page, which has the logo on top and the navigation bar under. I am planning to have these elements in every page to have consistency.
       In the home page, the user starts out by choosing a broad material type, such as plastic or metals.
       <br>
    After the user chooses a material type, they are lead to the page for each material type. The categories get smaller, and the user chooses which subcategory to learn about.
