        For my website test, I had three different users interacts with my website. 
        <br>
        I learned many things from user feedback. The following is the notes I received:
            <br>
            <br>
        <ul>
            <li>  On the PET page: scroll down on page is not intuitive.</li>
            <li>  Common uses seems clickable but is not clickable. </li>
            <li>  The production process was not clear to interact with. Users thought it might be linked to the video.</li>
            <li>  The language for the production process is complicated and hard to understand.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Based on user testing, here are the revisions I need to make:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li> Improve typeface so that there is a better hierarchy to the different sections.</li>
            <li> Improve the design to also separate the different sections </li>
            <li> Remove mouse clicker button on hover over for "Common Uses"</li>
            <li> Simplify language in production process for all users to understand. </li>
        
        
        </ul>
