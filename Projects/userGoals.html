        <h1> User Goals </h1>
    
       <b> How will your users understand the content of the project? </b>
        <br>
        The title of the website: "How Things Are Made" gives an initial understanding of the content of the project. In addition, I will give a short summary in the home page of how the website works, and what it's function is.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>How will your users understand the primary objectives?</b>
        <br>
        The primary objectives will be explained in the home page summary.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</b>
        <br>
        This website shows how certain materials are made and the lifecycle analysis of each material. There should be a navigation to search each material. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are 
their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?</b>
        This interactive project should be intuitive and easy to operate. It is designed for all age groups so that users of all ages can easilt understand the content.
        I seek to create each material to be an interactive learning experience that should be fun to use.
