<h3>Where to Donate Your Stuff: 101 Places Your Clutter Can Do Good</h3>    
    The article, <a href= "http://www.missminimalist.com/2011/04/where-to-donate-your-stuff-101-places-your-clutter-can-do-good/">"Where to Donate Your Stuff: 101 Places Your Clutter Can Do Good"</a> by Miss Minimalist discusses how one can donate ones discarded items. There is a long list of 101 places such as churches, hospitals, schools, libraries, shelters, food banks, and so on, that one can donate goods. The list includes non-profit organization such as Goodwill and Salvation Army. The issue with these charity non-profit organizations is that the employees and CEOs of these corporations still need to be paid. From this perspective, we can see that large charity organizations are not completely non-profit. In addition, there are so many different charity organizations, that an average person that wants to donate goods can find it very difficult to choose which organization to donate to. Then, after the donation is made, a percentage is taken out so that the employees of that organization can be paid. I wish to create an online platform that can somehow link all charity organizations together so that someone can donate very easily. Alternatively, the platform I create can be a direct source for people in need to obtain products from donators without a third-party receiving a contribution. 
    
    
    <h3>Goodwillâ€™s Charity Racket: CEOs Earn Top-Dollar, Workers Paid Less Than Minimum Wage</h3>
    
    <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-hrabe/the-worst-corporation-in-_b_1876905.html">This article</a> from the Huffington post shows just how much Goodwill Industries makes from its "non-profit" business. Some employees earn just 22 cents per hour, while the CEO earns about half a million dollars per year. This shows us the true nature of "non-profit" organizations in America. These organizations are truly for profit for the select few, under the guise of a charity program. There are many positive effects of Goodwill, however, it must be noted that Goodwill is still a corporation that makes money and must pay thousands of employees. I know that there must be some alternative that is truly non-profit. 
    
    <h3>Nonprofit Taxes: When Nonprofits Make a Profit</h3>
    <a href="http://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/incorporation-and-legal-structures/non-profit-taxes-when-non-profits-make-a-profit.html">This article</a> shows the legal side of non-profit organizations. Non-profits have special tax treatment for all government related activities. Non-related activities that are for-profit are allowed. However, the IRS has admitted that distinguishing between related and unrelated activities is difficult. Therefore, it is easy for non-profit organizations to carry out profitable activities without being taxed.
