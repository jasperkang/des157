        "Designlife-cycle.com is a work-in-progress project by design undergraduate students at the University of California Department of Design.  Each of these entries is a group project undertaken by students in DES 40A:  Energy, Materials and Design Across Time, a required design history course for the design major.  The class is designed and taught by Professor Christina Cogdell, who can be reached at cgcogdell@ucdavis.edu  The website is still under construction, and as the class is repeated each year, the contributions will grow."
